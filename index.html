 <h2>Ashley Perkins</h2>
 <p> My name is Ashley Perkins and I am a second year student in the Faculty of Science and Technology.
     I am currently pursuing a degree in Computer Science with hopes of helping to improve technology,
     as well as using my creative and innovative skills to work at Apple. In my spare time, I enjoy
     connecting with my creative side by creating graphic designs as well doing videography and photography.
     Interestingly, my interest in Web Development began in Comp1220 when we were introduced to creating webpages.
     The creation of these webpages gave me full control of how I wanted the design and feel of the website to look 
     and so it allowed me to express my creatuve vision similar to that of my hobbies. For this reason, I decided 
     to enroll in this course in an effort to gain more knowledge on web development and use these skills in the future 
     to create something unique and marvellous.</p>
